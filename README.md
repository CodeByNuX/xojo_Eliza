# ELIZA Rewired

> *“Pull up a chair, bask in the CRT glow, and chat like it’s 1988 — but with 2025 smarts.”*

### 🧠 What is Eliza Rewired?

In the late 1980s, I sat mesmerized in front of my friend’s 386 PC, playing with a mysterious little `.exe` called **Eliza**. It was my first exposure to a program that talked back — flipping “I” to “you,” echoing feelings, and making you wonder if maybe, just maybe, it *understood*.

Of course, it didn’t. But it *felt* like it did. And that feeling stuck with me.

**Eliza Rewired** is my homage to that early experience — a reimagining of the original therapeutic chatbot using modern tools, powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT API. It blends nostalgia with real AI smarts, and adds customizable personalities so you can shape how Eliza behaves.
